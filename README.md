This folder, attic, contains code fragments. 

Like most attics, this attic needs a good cleaning.

Some fragments are from the usual places on the web, cplusplus.com, stackoverflow, etc.

Some fragments are DIY code written in class.

Some fragments are as-is as found on the web while others are heavily modified to make work or add functionality.


Some fragments are useful, some are not.

Most fragments work, some don't.
